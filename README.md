A Yeoman Front-End Boilerplate Generator

This is my first attempt at a generator, and a way for me to familiarize with nodejs. Please bear with me while I painfully try to improve my skills.

## Features

* Built-in preview server with LiveReload
* Automatic compilation of SCSS with Compass
* Image Optimization
* Assemble.io templating engine

## Getting Started

- Install dependencies: `npm install --global yo gulp bower`
- Install the generator: `npm install --global generator-gulp-quickstarter`
- Run `yo gulp-quickstarter` to scaffold your app
- Run `gulp serve` to preview and watch for changes
- Run `bower install --save <package>` to install frontend dependencies
- Run `gulp` to build your webapp for production
- Run `gulp optimize` to minify CSS & JS
